# Quantum Annealing for solving QUBO Problems

Python implementation of QALS: Pastorello, D. and Blanzieri, E., 2019. Quantum annealing learning search for solving QUBO problems. Quantum Information Processing, 18(10), p.303.

We apply particular case of QALS (TEQAHQO) to local qubit reordering to perform quantum circuit optimization by minimizing SWAP count.
To start the program run *qubovert_qals.py* script. By default, Toffoli gate (initialized with the set of gates and gate dependecies) is optimized.
