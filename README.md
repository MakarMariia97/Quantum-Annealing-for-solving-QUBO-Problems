# Quantum Annealing for solving QUBO Problems

Python implementation of QALS: Pastorello, D. and Blanzieri, E., 2019. Quantum annealing learning search for solving QUBO problems. Quantum Information Processing, 18(10), p.303.

We apply it to optimizt quantum circuit by minimizing SWAP count. To start the program run *qubovert_qals.py* script. By default, Toffoli gate is optimized.
